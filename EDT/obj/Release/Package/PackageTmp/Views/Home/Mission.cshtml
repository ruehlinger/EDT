    <h3><u><strong>Definition of Training</strong></u></h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Training is an activity that is directly linked to individual job competencies. It contains:

        <ul>
            <li>Clear learning objectives related to job performance;</li>
            <li>An assessment mechanism to analyze whether the learning objectives were met; </li>
            <li>Content that allows the employee to practice and reflect on the material being taught; and </li>
            <li>An assessment mechanism to determine whether the training was effective. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In VBA, there are three general categories of training.

        <ol>
            <li>Technical training that is line of business (LoB) specific, focused on technical competencies. </li>
            <li>Leadership development focused on leadership competencies. </li>
            <li>Professional development, focused on all employee competencies.</li>
        </ol>
